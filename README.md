## 👨‍💻 About Me

I started my career in marketing, contributing to brand growth and customer acquisition initiatives. While working closely with campaign performance metrics, I developed a strong interest in analytics and data-backed decision-making.

I intentionally transitioned into analytics, strengthening my technical skills through hands-on projects, live campaigns, internships, and freelance work.
